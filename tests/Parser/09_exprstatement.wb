/* 09_exprstatement.wb

   Normally expressions appear in combination with statements such
   as print.  However, an expression can appear all by itself with
   a terminating semicolon.

   Note: This is likely to be a weird corner case in your parser.
   If you choose to ignore it, you'll get by fine with the project,
   but just be aware that it's a potential issue for later.
