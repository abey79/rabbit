Wabbit has mathematical operators such as +, -.  These
come in two varieties--binary operators that work
on two values and unary operators that operate on a
single value. */

print 2 + 3;      // Binary operator (+)
print -5;         // Unary operator (-)

/* You also need to think about precedence and associativity */

print 2 + 3 * 4;
print 2 * 3 + 4;
print (2 + 3) * 4;
